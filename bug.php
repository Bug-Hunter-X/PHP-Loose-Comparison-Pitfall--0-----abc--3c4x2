This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  Consider the following:

```php
<?php
if (0 == 'abc') {
  echo 'Equal!';
} else {
  echo 'Not equal!';
}
?>
```

This will output 'Equal!' because PHP's loose comparison (`==`) will attempt to convert the string 'abc' to a number. Since 'abc' cannot be converted to a numerical value, it becomes 0, resulting in a comparison of 0 == 0. This can lead to unexpected behavior in conditional statements.
