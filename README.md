# PHP Loose Comparison Pitfall

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in PHP related to its loose comparison operator (`==`).  When comparing an integer (0) with a string ('abc') using `==`, PHP performs type juggling, leading to unexpected results.

## The Bug

The file `bug.php` contains code that showcases this issue.  The loose comparison (0 == 'abc') evaluates to true because PHP converts the string 'abc' to an integer (0) before comparison.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.php` file demonstrates the correct approach, using strict comparison (`===`) to prevent type juggling. Strict comparison ensures that the types of the operands are checked as well as their values.

This example highlights the importance of understanding PHP's type juggling and using strict comparison (`===`) whenever possible to avoid unexpected behavior and improve code reliability.
